# Description for project

This is a travel agency website and I added the following functions
- Contact Form so that the superuser can receive the message / feedback from user via gmail.
- Q and A which the superuser can add / delete from admin page and we can confirm the adjustments on actual website.

Issue:
- I haven't added the way to pay for service.
- NO RESPONSIVE. This is only for desktop / laptop
